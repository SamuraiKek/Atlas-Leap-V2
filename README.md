# Atlas Leap V2
A 3D printable adapter that lets you mount a Herman Miller Atlas headrest to a Steelcase Leap V2 chair without making any intrusive changes to you Leap chair. 
 
Recommended infill settings: 20%-30%.

I'm done improving on the design, but for those of you that whish to further tinker with it, I've included a .step file that can be easily imported and modified with a 3D modelling software like Fusion 360.
